ReactJS Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model). React uses this lightweight JavaScript object to track changes in the application state and efficiently update the actual DOM only where necessary.
The virtual DOM (VDOM) is an important aspect of how React works. It is a lightweight in-memory representation of the DOM (Document Object Model), and it is used to optimize the rendering of components in a React application.
Virtual DOM is abstraction on top of the actual DOM where an ideal, or "virtual', representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the 'real' DOM.
