# What are hooks?
Hooks is a special JavaScript function that allows you use state and other React features without writing a class. This pattern has been introduced as a new feature in React 16.8 and helped to isolate the stateful logic from the components.

Note: Hooks can be used inside an existing function component without rewriting the component.

#2 :- React Hooks are functions that enable functional components to use React state and lifecycle features. They eliminate the need for class components, making code cleaner and easier to maintain.
